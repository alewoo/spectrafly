# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

**Product Summary:**  
SpectraFly is a real-time ingestion and distribution system for financial articles. It will ingest large volumes of articles from multiple sources, parse them into structured data, and provide near-real-time access via APIs and subscriptions. The goal is to support fast, data-driven insights for analysts and quants.

**Goals & Objectives:**

- Ingest at least 100 articles per minute.
- Parse unstructured text into publisher, author, date, title, body, sector.
- Provide real-time subscription endpoints for downstream consumers.
- Offer an extensible platform to easily add new feeds and classification rules.

**Target Audience:**

- Internal research analysts, quants, data scientists, and developers at Company X who need timely market data.

**Scope:**

- In-scope: Article ingestion, parsing, storage, APIs, subscription feeds, dashboard.
- Out-of-scope: Advanced NLP models (beyond basic sector classification), user-facing front-end GUIs for the public.

## 2. Key Features & Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Ingestion:** Ability to handle multiple feeds (RSS, APIs, webhooks), normalize raw data, and queue articles for processing.
- **Parsing & Structuring:** Extract publisher, author, date published, title, body, and classify sector.
- **Storage:** Store articles in a database with indexes for fast retrieval.
- **API & Subscription:** Provide REST endpoints for querying articles and SSE or WebSocket endpoint for real-time article delivery.
- **Extensibility:** Modular design to add new feeds, update parsing logic, or integrate new sector classifiers.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Handle ≥100 articles/min with <10s latency from ingestion to availability.
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling of ingestion and parsing components.
- **Security:** Authenticated access to APIs, encryption in transit (HTTPS).
- **Maintainability:** Clear documentation, logging, and monitoring.

## 3. User Flows

- Admin adds new feeds, configures intervals, and monitors system via dashboard.
- Analysts query the API for filtered articles or subscribe to real-time updates.
- System handles errors gracefully and logs issues.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- Successfully ingesting and structuring at least 100 articles/min.
- Real-time endpoint delivering new articles within 10s.
- API queries return valid JSON responses under 500ms for normal loads.

## 5. Timeline & Milestones

- M1: Basic ingestion pipeline.
- M2: Parsing logic and database setup.
- M3: API endpoints and real-time feed.
- M4: Monitoring, scaling tests, and documentation.
